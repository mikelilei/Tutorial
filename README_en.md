Welcome to Git Drive
=================================
Git Drive is a system especially designed for iOS，enabling Git version control software to be operated on mobile devices, by which your iOS device becomes a perfectly functioning Git version control server that fits in the palm of your hand. All you only need to do is install the application from the Apple App Store; there is no tedious, multi-step installation process or any further effort required – a Git version control server will be set up within minutes. The Git Smart transfer protocol is fully implemented on this server, including transmission stability and speed. Authorization of other users for repository access is under your complete control, and shallow updates and cloning operations for the repository are also supported.

Because of Git’s distributed architecture, damage at a singular location will not lead to an entire system breakdown; in this way, Git Drive is extremely suitable for use as a node within a Git storage network – and this node can be carried with you wherever you go. 

Besides acting as a perfectly functioning Git version control server, the Git Drive software also acts as a powerful Git client, offering enough functionality for you to effectively manage changes to the repository and check up on any documents directly from the application.

Git Drive offers a different way to manage your code other than conventional code-management models. For example, when using Git Drive, your code is stored on your personal device – and if you are also using iCloud, any repository can be available on any device, step-by-step and in real time. Only through this model are you able to fully utilize the available space on your iPhone or iPad as storage for all of your important data. It facilitates convenient data exchange among a working team, while at the same time saving you the cost and time of setting up a personal Git version control server.
